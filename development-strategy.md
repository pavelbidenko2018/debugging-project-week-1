# Project Development Strategy

##  `Debugging-Project-WEEK1`

### Description
This is a collaborative HTML, CSS and JavaScript project. It consists of single dynamic webpage and 6 JS functions with the appropriate handlers.  
It could be useful to boost team-developing skills, to practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS3 frameworks and to get used to develop in a test-based environment.  

It could be used as a set of easy to understand pure JavaScript examples.

> For this project we use an incremental development pattern, according to which each issue (UI or JS function) was developed in its own Git branch, reviewed and then added to the main project.

### 0. Set-Up

> On this step the project repo was generated from template.  

Steps:
- GitHub repo project was set up with the bunch of corresponding issues.
- Write initial, basic README


### 1. Creating UI

> On this step entire UI was set up. So the user can see a styled web page with a set of buttons each of which will be linked with JS function handler.

Steps: 
* A new repo branch ```html-css``` was created.
* HTML markup was developed. 
* CSS styling was added.
* The GitHub pull request was reviewed by reviewers and the branch was merged to the ```master``` branch.  

### 2. Developing ```Convert to F``` function and its handler.

> On this step user can run a function ```Convert to F``` by pressing on appropriate button.  
This function converts converts the ```Celcius``` temperature value to ```Fahrenheit``` value. 

Steps: 
* The new repo branch ```convert-to-f```was generated
* The core logic function was developed
* It was passed through a set of tests
* An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interectively.
* PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch 
was merged to the ```master``` branch.


### 3. Developing ```Convert to C``` function and its handler.

> On this step user can run a function ```Convert to C``` by pressing on appropriate button.  
This function is like a previous one but converts the ```Fahrenheit``` temperature value  to ```Celcius```. 

Steps: 
* The new repo branch ```convert-to-c```was generated.
* The core logic function was developed
* It was passed through a set of tests
* An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interectively.
* PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch 
was merged to the ```master``` branch.

### 4. Developing ```Confirm Ending``` function and its handler.

> On this step user can run a function ```confirmEnding()``` by pressing on appropriate button.  
This function checks if the user correctly types the ending letters of the string value which was entered by the previous prompt. 

Developing steps are similar to the previous: 
* The new repo branch ```confirm-ending-script```was generated.
* The core logic function was developed.
* It was passed through a set of tests.
* An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interectively.
* PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch. 
was merged to the ```master``` branch.

### 5. Developing ```findLongestWordLength``` function and its handler.

> On this step user can run a function ```findLongestWordLength()``` by pressing on appropriate button.  
This function finds the longest word in the input string, calculates and show user the quntity of symbols.  if the user correctly types the ending letters of the string value which was entered by the previous prompt. 

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development: 
* The new repo branch ```find-longest-word-length```was generated.
* The core logic function was developed.
* It was passed through a set of tests.
* An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interectively.
* PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch. 
was merged to the ```master``` branch.

### 6. Developing ```Repeat String Num Times``` function and its handler.

> On this step user can run a function ```repeat-string-num-times()``` by pressing on appropriate button.  
This function prompts a user to enter a string, on the second step it prompts to enter a number of times this string would be repeated and display the resulting string. 

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development: 
* The new repo branch ```repeat-string-num-times```was generated.
* The core logic function was developed.
* It was passed through a set of tests.
* An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interectively.
* PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch. 
was merged to the ```master``` branch.

### 7. Developing ```Reverse a String``` function and its handler.

> On this step user can run a function ```reverse-a-string()``` by pressing on appropriate button.  
This function reverses each word in the input string and displays the resulting string.

Developing steps are similar to the the all project issues which concern JavaScript development: 
* The new repo branch ```reverse-a-string```was generated.
* The core logic function was developed.
* It was passed through a set of tests.
* An appropriate handler was developed to use the function interectively.
* PR was raised, reviewed by two assigned reviewers and the branch. 
was merged to the ```master``` branch.

### Finishing Touches
On this step README file was completed in the separate branch ```readme``` which is merged to the ```master```
* W3C code validation made
